People gathered over the weekend to take a stand against the violence and hate that Asian Americans face holding rallies and vigils across the US after the deadly shootings at three spas in the Atlanta area

The shootings Tuesday left eight people dead including six Asian women The attacks came during a rise in hate incidents against Asians in the US and prompted conversations about the hypersexualization routinely faced by Asian women the suspect allegedly had been a customer at two of the spas and told police he had a sex addiction

As the crimes inspired feelings of anger and fear people also responded with calls to action Rallies in various cities called for an end to racism and solidarity with the Asian American and Pacific Islander communities Vigils honored the victims who were remembered for their hard work and compassion and the love they shared with their families

Where it was initially pro Trump it digressed to anti government anti Congress anti institutional Mr Sherwin said And then I eventually saw people climbing the scaffolding The scaffolding was being set up for the inauguration When I saw people climbing up the scaffolding hanging from it hanging flags I was like This is going bad fast

From the start Mr Sherwin oversaw the investigation as the acting US attorney in Washington a role that he ceded to a new interim leader in early March He stepped down from leading the investigation on Friday and returned to Miami where he had been a line prosecutor

Mr Sherwin told 60 Minutes that the government had charged more than 400 people Among them are hundreds accused of trespassing and more than 100 accused of assaulting officers including Brian D Sicknick the Capitol Police officer who died after fighting with rioters

Mr Sicknick and two other officers were sprayed with an unidentified chemical agent that one of the assailants said was used to repel bears

A medical examiner has not determined how Officer Sicknick died Mr Sherwin said so two suspects were charged with assaulting an officer instead of murder But that could change he said

If evidence directly relates that chemical to his death Mr Sherwin said in that scenario correct thats a murder case

Mr Sherwin said that only about 10 percent of the cases so far dealt with more complicated conspiracies planned and executed by far right extremists including members of the Oath Keepers the Three Percenters and the Proud Boys to organize come to Washington and breach the Capitol

He reiterated assertions he made shortly after the attack that prosecutors were examining the conduct of former President Donald J Trump who had told his supporters to attend the rally on Jan 6 and egged them on with baseless claims that he had won the election

Its unequivocal that Trump was the magnet that brought the people to DC on the 6th Now the question is is he criminally culpable for everything that happened during the siege during the breach? Mr Sherwin said

We have people looking at everything he said The number of transgender people who hide their trans identity at work has risen sharply in the past five years research has shown

 According to a report by recruitment firm TotalJobs almost two-thirds of trans people 65 believe it is necessary to keep their identity secret from colleagues to feel safe and secure in their jobs Five years ago just over half of trans people felt this way

 To hear that the number of trans people experiencing this has increased since our last report in 2016 is deeply concerning said Jon Wilson CEO of TotalJobs As employers we need to ask serious questions as to what we can do to improve this state of affairs and ensure were championing a culture that is inclusive of trans individuals

 The report is based on a YouGov survey of over 400 trans workers one of the largest research samples of its kind to date in the UK

 Half of the respondents said that they had left a job because a work environment was unwelcoming a 7 increase since 2016 The reports authors suggested workers feel their best solution to discrimination is to find a new job rather than trust their employer to step in This is despite the legal protection from discrimination that trans people have under the Equality Act 2010 A third of respondents reported being bullied at work including being deliberately addressed by the wrong name or pronoun

 There were some positive findings including fewer negative experiences in job hunting For instance a fifth of respondents said they had experienced discrimination while applying for a job down from almost a third five years ago

 Lee Clatworthy of transgender charity Sparkle believes this positive trend could be encouraged further We would recommend de-gendering the language on application forms and throughout the recruitment process to ensure the first interaction with your company is as inclusive as possible

 The survey data showed that the number of people reacting positively to a colleague coming out as trans remained steady at 50 while the percentage of those reacting overtly negatively dropped from 10 five years ago to 5 now

 Ben Hodge a 21-year-old transgender student in Manchester said he has noticed people becoming less openly hostile through his experience of part-time work including as a theatre usher and in TV production From my first ever job in a milkshake shop when I was 17 I have definitely seen attitudes change My first manager never said anything directly to me but he often spoke negatively about another trans colleague to my workmates

 However he said that being trans could still cause stress at work If something was to ever happen to me in the workplace that I contribute to I might not be supported Its hard not to feel like Im a lower status citizen compared to my colleagues just for being my true self
